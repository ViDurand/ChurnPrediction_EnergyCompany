Unsupervised Feature selection
	Manual analysis
		-> Step 1: Manually analyzing columns. output: Keep, Remove, Maybe

	Automatic analysis
		-> Step 2: Data Cleaning -> replacing NAs
		-> Step 3: Create new features (val_day_t0, val_month_t0, ...)
		-> Step 4: Check the maybe cases. by computing correlations output: Keep or Remove
		-> Step 5: Data Transformation -> Transforming categorical data to numerical
		-> Step 6: Check for auto-corelation among the features
	
Supervised Feature selection
	-> Step 4: Check if Data Set is Unbalanced
	Filter
		-> Statistical Methods to measure correlation with the target
		-> Feature Importance Methods

	-> Convert categorical to numerical
	
	Wrapper
		-> RFE (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html)
	
	Intrinsic
	
		-> Lasso
		-> Decision trees
		-> Random Forest
		-> RFE (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html)
