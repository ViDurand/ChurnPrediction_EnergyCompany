Abstract
Customer churn is the focal concern of most companies which are active in industries with
low switching cost. Among all industries which suffer from this issue, telecommunications
industry can be considered in the top of the list with approximate annual churn rate of 30%.
Tackling this problem, there exist different approaches via developing predictive models for
customers churn, but due to the nature of pre-paid mobile telephony market which is not
contract-based, customer churn is not easily traceable and definable, thus constructing a
predictive model would be of high complexity. Handling this issue, in this study, we
developed a dual-step model building approach, which consists of clustering phase and
classification phase. With this regard firstly, the customer base was divided into four clusters,
based on their RFM related features, with the aim of extracting a logical definition of churn,
and secondly, based on the churn definitions that were extracted in the first step, we
conducted the second step which was the model building phase. In the model building phase
firstly the Decision Tree (CART algorithm) was utilized in order to build the predictive
model, afterwards with the aim of comparing the performance of different algorithms, Neural
Networks algorithm and different algorithms of Decision Tree were utilized to construct the
predictive models for churn in our developed clusters. Evaluating and comparing the
performance of the employed algorithms based on “Gain measure”, we concluded that
employing a multi-algorithm approach in which different algorithms are used for different
clusters, can bring the maximum “Gain” among the tested algorithms.
Furthermore, dealing with our imbalanced dataset, we tested the cost- sensitive learning
method as a remedy for handling the class imbalance. Regarding the results, both simple and
cost-sensitive predictive models have a considerable higher performance than random
sampling in both CART model and multi-algorithm model. Additionally, according to our
study, cost-sensitive learning was proved to outperform the simple model only in CART
model but not in the multi-algorithm.
Key words: Customer relationship management; customer churn; data mining

Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1. Introduction
Acquisition and retention of new clients are one of the most significant concerns of
businesses. While recipient companies concentrate on acquiring new customers, mature ones
try to focus on retention of the existing ones in order to provide themselves with the
opportunity of cross – selling. According to Freeman (1999) one of the most significant ways
of increasing customers’ value is to keep them for longer period of time.
In the new era emergence of electronic commerce has boosted the available information,
and as Peppard (2000) believes, the internet channel has empowered the customers who are
no longer stuck with the decisions of a single company and has led to exacerbation of the
competition, while competitors are only one “click away”, customer empowerment is likely
to amplify the attrition rate of a company’s customers (Lejeune, 2001). Facing with this threat
companies should be equipped and armed with the most efficient and effective methods of
examining their client’s behavior predicting their possible future failure.
In accordance with (Lejeune, 2001) churn management consists of developing techniques
that enable firms in keeping their profitable customers.
The study at your disposal aims at finding an efficient and accurate predictive model for
customer churn in pre-paid mobile telephony market segment by utilizing machine learning
techniques.

8

With the intention of making you more familiar with the research’s realm and its importance
we start the report by providing you with statistics regarding the customer churn
magnification in telecommunications industry and afterwards we address our problem
definition and the question of our research.

1.2. Churn magnitude in telecommunications industry
The mobile telephony market is one of the fastest-growing service segments in
telecommunications, and more than 75% of all potential phone calls worldwide can be made
through mobile phones and as with the any other competitive markets, the mode of
competition has shifted from acquisition to retention of customers (Kim & Yoon, 2004).
Regarding this, examining the existing statistics concerning churn magnitude and its costs in
this realm would be beneficial for gaining an appropriate mental picture of the importance of
this area of research:

• SAS (2000) reported that the telecommunications sector endures an annual rate of churn,
ranging from 25 per cent to 30 percent this churn rate could still continue to increase in
correlation with the growth of the market.

• Churn costs for European and US telecommunications companies are estimated to
amount to US$4 billion annually (SAS Institute, 2000)

• The ratio (customer acquisition costs/ customer retention or satisfaction costs) would be
equal to eight for the wireless companies (SAS Institute, 2000).
While the annual rate of customer churn in telecommunications sector is around 30 percent
(Groth, 1999; SAS Institute, 2000) and it costs US$ 4 billion per year for European and US
telecommunications companies, it would seem reasonable to invest more on churn
management rather than acquisition management for mature companies especially when we
notice that the cost of acquiring a new customer is eight times more than retaining an existing
one (SAS Institute, 2000).

1.3. Problem definition
Customer churn is the focal concern of most companies which are active in industries with
low switching cost. Among all industries which suffer from this issue, telecommunications
9

industry can be considered in the top of the list with approximate annual churn rate of 30%.
This means wasting the money and efforts or as Kotler and Keller (2006) mentioned, “it is
like adding water to a leaking bucket”.
Consequently, in order to tackle this problem we must recognize the churners before they
churn, so developing a model which predicts the future churners seems to be vital. This
model has to be able to recognize the customers which tend to churn in close future. But, due
to the nature of pre-paid mobile telephony market which is not contract-based, customer
churn is not easily traceable and also definable, thus building a predictive model would be of
high complexity. In order to achieve such goal in pre-paid market segment the initial step
appears to be defining the churn and a churner and then predicting the churn. Furthermore,
due to the nature of churn datasets in which the churn class is always suffering from rarity,
handling such imbalance in the dataset can help to improve the model’s performance.

1.4. Research Purpose
The purpose of this research is to develop and design an effective and efficient model for
customer churn prediction in telecommunication industry (Pre-paid mobile telephony
market).

1.5. Research Question
1- How “customer churn” can be defined in pre-paid mobile telephony service
providers?
2- What features can be utilized in order to build a predictive model for customer churn
in pre-paid mobile telephony industry?
3- What are the remedies for data imbalance in churn data sets?

1.6. Thesis structure
This thesis report starts with defining and explaining the research problem and providing the
readers with the magnification and importance of the problem and exploiting the definition of
problem and purpose of the research, it provides you with the research questions.

Chapter 2 Literature Review
2.1. Introduction
The current chapter consists of three individual sections. The first section aims at
introducing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and its basic concepts while it also
tries to depict the contribution of machine learning techniques (Especially Data Mining) to
this realm. Section two is an introductory part to Data Mining and its significance role in
CRM. The second section ends with addressing the most common and applicable Data
Mining models and techniques in CRM which have also been utilized in this research’s
model building phase, and ultimately the third section

represents the existing studies

regarding the customer churn in different industries. Although the focus of this research is on
machine learning predictive models for customer churn, this chapter has taken a look at churn
literature from both explanatory and predictive point of view in order to broaden the visions
toward all sides of churn issue.

2.2. Customer Relationship Management: Basic Concepts
Eagerness toward Customer Relationship Management (CRM) began to grow in 1990 (Ling
& Yen, 2001; Xu, Yen, Lin, & Chou, 2002). A developed relationship with one’s clients can
finally result in greater customer loyalty and retention and, also profitability (Ngai, 2005).

12

Despite the fact that CRM has become widely recognized, there is no comprehensive and
universally accepted definition of CRM.
Swift (2001) defined CRM as an” enterprise approach to understanding and influencing
customer behavior through meaningful communications in order to improve customer
acquisition, customer retention, customer loyalty, and customer profitability. Kotler and
Keller (2006) have defined Customer relationship management (CRM) as the process of
managing detailed information about individual customers and carefully managing all
customer "touch points" to maximize customer loyalty. Kincaid (2003) viewed CRM as “the
strategic use of information, processes, technology, and people to manage the customer’s
relationship with your company (Marketing, Sales, Services, and Support) across the whole
customer life cycle”. Bose (2002) viewed CRM as an integration of technologies and
business processes used to satisfy the needs of a customer during any given interaction more
specifically from his point of view Customer relationship management (CRM) involves
acquisition, analysis and use of knowledge about customers in order to sell goods or services
and to do it more efficiently. Richards and Jones (2008) have defined CRM as “a set of
business activities supported by both technology and processes that is directed by strategy
and is designed to improve business performance in an area of customer management”.
Having a glimpse to the above mentioned definitions of CRM one can understand that all
above authors’ emphasis is on considering CRM as a “comprehensive strategy and process of
acquiring, retaining, and partnering with selective customers to create superior value for the
company and the customer. It involves the integration of marketing, sales, customer service,
and supply – chain functions of the organization to achieve greater efficiencies and
effectiveness in delivering customer value.” (Parvatiyar & Sheth, 2001).
Olafsson, Li, and Wu (2008) believe that a valuable customer is usually dynamic and the
relationship evolves and changes over time. Thus, a critical role of CRM is to understand this
relationship. This is achievable by studying the customer life-cycle, or customer lifetime,
which refers to various stages of the relationship between customer and business (Olafsson,
Li, & Wu, 2008). A typical customer life-cycle is shown in Figure 2.1.

13

Figure 2.1: Illustration of a customer life-cycle (source: Olafsson, Li, & Wu, 2008)
As it is presented in the above figure, a prospect that responds to the marketing campaigns
of the company in acquisition phase, becomes a customer and this “New Customer” becomes
a established one once the relationship between him/her and the company has been
established and this is the point that in which the company can benefit from its established
customers by revenue that comes from cross – selling and up – selling, but the peril that
threatens the company in this stage is that at some point established customers stop being
customers (Churn) (Olafsson, Li, & Wu, 2008). Thus, in simple words, the main goal of
customer relationship management is to create satisfaction and delight among customers in
order to prevent customer churn which is the most important threat that threatens all
companies. It has been shown that a small change in retention rate can result in significant
changes in contribution (Van den Poel & Larivie're, 2004).
In accordance with Rayls CRM falls in two categories; attracting new customers what he
calls offensive marketing, and keeping the existing customers, known as defensive marketing
(Ryals, 2005). While acquiring new customers is the first step for any businesses to start
growing, the importance of retaining customers should not be overlooked. Reinartz, Thomas
& Kumar showed that insufficient allocation to customer-retention efforts will have a greater
impact on long-term customer profitability as compared to insufficient allocation to
customer-acquisition efforts (Reinartz, Thomas, & Kumar, 2005). As Chu, Tsai, and Ho have
highlighted the cost of acquiring a new customer is five to ten times greater than that of
retaining existing subscribers (Chu, Tsai, & Ho, 2007). Even if we put aside the existing
14

studies, which mentioned that it costs more to acquire new customers than to retain the
existing customers, we can consider that customer retention is more important than customer
acquisition because lack of information on new customers makes it difficult to select target
customers and this will cause inefficient marketing efforts.
The emergence of electronic commerce has increased the amount of available information
and so offers new ways for companies to efficiently respond to clients’ expectations.
Meanwhile, customers can more easily get information about the market opportunities. They
become more demanding and tend to switch from their previous supplier to another. This
gave birth to the notion of churn (Lejeune, 2001).
During 1850s businesses were able to sell anything they made and generally the focus was
on production. In early 1900 the customer empowerment forced firms to find reasons for
people to buy their products. In the mid 20th century a paradigm shift occurred and firms
started making what people wanted instead of trying to persuade them to buy whatever they
had to sell. This new marketing orientation leaded to customer centric orientation in 21st
century. A customer centric orientation is capable of treating all customers individually
depending on customer preference (Bose, 2002). In fact today’s variety of tastes and
preferences among customers has made it impossible for the companies to group them into
large homogenous populations to develop marketing strategies and what actually firms are
facing with are customers who want to be served according to their individual and unique
needs (Shaw, Subramaniam, Tan, & Welge, 2001).
This, gave birth to the need of IT and knowledge management in the realm of Customer
Relationship Management. In fact in a broader view CRM can be presented in the form of
customer management which requires the collection and treatment of a significant amount of
data that enables companies to exploit them in acquisition, retention, extension, and also
selection of their customers (Komenar, 1997).
In the IT realm, CRM means an enterprise wide integration of technologies such as data
warehouse, website, intranet/extranet, etc (Bose, 2002). In fact CRM utilizes information
Technology and Information Systems to gather data which can be used to develop required
information to create a one-to-one interaction with the customers (Bose, 2002; Ngai, 2005).

15

In actual fact, turning the dream of one-to-one marketing would be impossible in the
absence of IT contributions. Although there are some controversies among academics about
the key components of IT success in one-to-one marketing (Bose, 2002; Wells, Fuerst, &
Choobineh, 1999), most experts confirm the necessity of IT in this field.
In fact it is the above mentioned need of individual recognition of customers that let the
Information technology to be combined with CRM and with this IT based perspective, CRM
can be defined as the integration of technologies and business process in order to satisfy the
customer needs in a given interaction. Thus, in new definition, CRM deals with acquisition,
analysis, and use of knowledge about customers in order to increase the sales volume in the
most efficient way (Bose, 2002).
There exists different categorization approaches toward CRM (Teo, Devadoss, & Pan, 2006;
Ngai, 2005; He, Xu, Huang, & Deng, 2004; Xu, Yen, Lin, & Chou, 2002). From the
architecture point of view, the CRM framework can be classified into operational and
analytical (He, Xu, Huang, & Deng, 2004; Teo, Devadoss, & Pan, 2006). While operational
CRM refers to the automation of business process, the analytical CRM refers to the analysis
of customer characteristics and attitudes in order to support the organization’s customer
management strategies. Thus, it can help the company in more effective allocation of its
resources (Ngai, Xiu, & Chau, 2009).
On the other hand Kincaid (2003), West (2001), Xu, Yen, Lin, & Chou (2002), and Ngai
(2005) believe that CRM falls in the four following categories:
1) Marketing
2) Sales
3) Service and support
4) IT and IS
According to what experts believe, the role of Information Technology (IT) and Information
Systems (IS) in CRM can’t be denied (Kincaid, 2003; Ling & Yen, 2001). Using IT and IS
will makes the companies capable of the collection of the necessary data to determine the
economics of customer acquisition, retention, and life – time value. This means involving the
use of database, data warehouse, and data mining (a complicated data search capability which

16

is able to discover patterns and correlations in data by using statistical algorithms) to help
organizations increase their customer retention rates and their own profitability (Ngai, 2005).
A review of the literature in CRM realm by Ngai (2005) reveals that since 1999, eagerness
toward this issue has boosted and a total of 191 publications were found to be from 2000 to
2002 which represents 93 percent the total publications in this field from 1992 to 2002 (see
figure.2.2). The research also depicts that a major part of the researches in CRM field is
related to the application of IT and IS in CRM. Furthermore in IT and IS field the first role is
played by data mining (Ngai, 2005) . This fact also has been confirmed in recent studies
(Ngai, Xiu, & Chau, 2009). That’s why Shaw, Subramaniam, Tan and Welge (2001) believe
that True Customer Relationship Management is possible only by integrating the knowledge
discovery process with the management and use of the knowledge for marketing strategies.

Figure 2.2: Distribution of articles by year (source: Ngai,2005)

Therefore one can conclude that the role of data mining in CRM process is fundamental and
critical (Rygielski, Wang, & Yen, 2002) and it enables us to transform customer data, which
is a company asset, into useful information and knowledge and exploit this knowledge in
identifying valuable customers, predicting future behaviors, and make proactive and
knowledge based decisions (Rygielski, Wang, & Yen, 2002) . In CRM context, data mining
can be seen as a business driven process, aimed at discovery and consistent use of knowledge
from organizational data (Ling & Yen, 2001).

17

Consequently, deep understanding of data mining and knowledge management in CRM
seems to be vital in today’s highly customer – centered business environment (Shaw,
Subramaniam, Tan, & Welge, 2001).

2.3. Data Mining and Its Application in CRM
Nowadays lack of data is no longer a problem, but the inability to extract useful information
from data is (Lee & Siau, 2001). Due to the constant increase in the amount of data
efficiently operable to managers and policy makers through high speed computers and rapid
data communication, there has grown and will continue to grow a greater dependency on
statistical methods as a means of extracting useful information from the abundant data
sources. Statistical methods provide an organized and structured way of looking at and
thinking about disorganized, unstructured appearing phenomena. Figure 2.3 illustrates the
different stages involved in the never – failing quest for more refined information (Lejeune,
2001).

Figure 2.3: Evolution in the quest for information (source: Lejeune, 2001)

In fact the accelerated growth in data and databases resulted in the need of developing new
techniques and tools to transform data into useful information and knowledge, intelligently
and automatically. Thus, data mining has become an area of research with an increasing
importance (Weiss and Indurkhya, 1998; cited by Lee & Siau, 2001). Data mining techniques
are the result of a long term research and product development and their origin have roots in
the first storage of data on computers, which was followed by improvement in data access

18

(Rygielski, Wang, & Yen, 2002). Table 2.1 depicts the evolutionary stages of data mining
from user’s point of view.

Data mining is “the process of selecting exploring and modeling large amount of data to
uncover previously unknown data patterns for business advantage” (SAS Institute, 2000). It
also can be defined as:” the exploration and analysis of large quantities of data in order to
discover meaningful patterns and rules” (Berry & Linoff, 2004) and it involves selecting,
exploring and modeling large amounts of data to uncover previously unknown patterns, and
finally comprehensible information, from large databases (Shaw, Subramaniam, Tan, &
Welge, 2001).What data mining tools do is to take data and construct a model as a
representation of reality. The resulted model describes patterns and relationships, present in
the data (Rygielski, Wang, & Yen, 2002).

19

The broad application of data mining falls in two major categories (Ngai, 2005):
1- Descriptive data mining: aims at increasing the understanding of the data and their
content;
2- Predictive or perspective data mining: aims at forecasting and devising, at orienting
the decision process.
Aiming at solving business problems, data mining can be used to build the following types
of models (Ngai, Xiu, & Chau, 2009):
•

Classification

•

Regression

•

Forecasting

•

Clustering

•

Association analysis

•

Sequence discovery

•

Visualization

Among the above mentioned models the first three one are prediction tools while
association analysis and sequence discovery are used for description and clustering is
applicable to either prediction or description.
The wide spread applications of data mining range from, evaluation of overall store
performance, promotions’ contribution to sales and determination of cross – selling
strategies, to segmentation of the customer base (Gomory, Hoch, Lee, Podlaseck, &
Schonberg, 1999). Moreover the data warehouse tools have enabled us to establish a
customer data base which includes both traditional sources such as customer demographics
data, and customer relationship data, and technical quality data (SAS Institute, 2000;
Srivastava, Cooley, Deshpande, & Tan, 2000).
The application of data mining tools in CRM is an emerging trend in global economy. Since
most companies try to analyze and understand their customers’ behaviors and characteristics,
for developing a competitive CRM strategy, data mining tools has become of high popularity
(Ngai, Xiu, & Chau, 2009).

20

Beside the aforementioned roles for data mining in marketing, Rygielski, Wang, and Yen
(2002) have identified a wide continuum of applications for data mining in marketing in
different industries, from retailing to banking and telecommunications industry.
According to Rygielski, Wang, and Yen (2002) in retailing data mining can be used to
perform basket analysis, sales forecasting, database marketing, and merchandise planning and
allocation. Besides, data mining-based CRM in banking industry can be utilized in card
marketing, cardholder pricing and profitability, fraud detection, and predictive life-cycle
management. In addition to the above mentioned realms, data mining possesses a significant
role in telecommunications industry. To be more specific, using data mining, companies
would be able to analyze call detail records and identify customer segments with similar use
patterns, and develop attractive pricing and feature promotions. Furthermore, data mining
enables companies to identify the characteristics of customers who are likely to remain loyal
and also determine the churners (Rygielski, Wang, & Yen, 2002).
With large volumes of data generated in CRM, data mining plays a leading role in the
overall CRM (Shaw, Subramaniam, Tan, & Welge, 2001). In acquisition campaigns data
mining can be used to profile people who have responded to previous similar campaigns and
these data mining profiles is helpful to find the best customer segments that the company
should target (Adomavicius & Tuzhilin, 2003). Another application is to look for prospects
that have similar behavior patterns to today’s established customers. In responding campaigns
data mining can be applied to determine which prospects will become responders and which
responders will become established customers. Established customers are also a significant
area for data mining. Identifying customer behavior patterns from customer usage data and
predicting which customers are likely to respond to cross-sell and up-sell campaigns, which
are very important to the business (Chiang and Lin, 2000 cited by Olafsson, Li,and Wu,
2008). A review of literature from 2000 to 2006 shows that 54 out of 87 papers (62%) in field
of data mining and CRM have focused on customer retention dimension of CRM. Besides,
the authors have spotted an increasing trend toward this area of research that makes us to
expect more publications in it (Ngai, Xiu, & Chau, 2009). Regarding former customers, data
mining can be used to analyze the reasons for churns and to predict churn (Chiang et al.,
2003; cited by Olafsson, Li,and Wu, 2008). Regarding this, there exist two different
conceptions which have been developed by Ansari, Kohavi, Mason, & Zheng (2000) and
Groth (1999). Ansari, Kohavi, Mason, & Zheng (2000) considered the importance of data,
21

related to Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) attributes for evaluating customer
churn, while Groth (1999) believes that considering the recency of purchase as a churn
indicator may lead us to misrepresent the infrequent shoppers and as Lejeune (2001) noted
such rules (RFM), neglect the purchasing behavior, that may significantly differ across
segments and individuals.
Groth prefers to hire a methodology called “Value, Activity, and loyalty method (VAL)”.
From this point of view using descriptive data mining, one can divide the customer in the
customer base into four classes on loyalty basis. According to Jones and Sasser (1995)
customers fall in one of the following categories:
1. Loyalists and apostles
2. Hostages
3. Defectors
4. Mercenaries
After assigning the existing customers to one of the above mentioned classes by the use of
descriptive data mining we would be able to use predictive data mining in order to specify the
customers who are likely to churn (Lejeune, 2001). Thus the need for predictive data mining
models arises.
Since in this research we utilized classification and clustering models in order to construct
our predictive models, in next two sections we’ll have a brief review of both model’s
definitions and their utilized techniques.

2.3.1. Classification
Classification is the most frequent learning model in data mining, especially in CRM field
and it is capable of predicting the effectiveness or profitability of a CRM strategy through
prediction of the customers’ behavior (Ahmad, 2004; Carrier & Povel, 2003; Ngai, Xiu, &
Chau, 2009). Classification can be defined as the process of finding a model (or function) that
describes and distinguishes data classes or concepts, for the purpose of being able to use the
model to predict the class of objects whose class label is unknown. The derived model is
based on the analysis of a set of training data (i.e., data objects whose class label is known)
(Han & Kamber, 2006) or as Lee and Siau (2001) noted the classification process is the
22

process of dividing a data set into mutually exclusive groups such that the members of each
group are as “close” as possible to one another, and the members of different groups are as
“far” as possible from one another. Also we can define the classification as “examining the
features of a newly presented object and assigning it to one of the predefined set of classes”
(Berry & Linoff, 2004). The objective of the classification is to first analyze the training data
and develop an accurate description or a model for each class using the attributes available in
the data. Such class descriptions are then used to classify future independent test data or to
develop a better description for each class (Weiss and Kulikowski, 1991; cited by Olafsson,
Li,and Wu, 2008).
Among all existing classification techniques Neural Network and Decision Tree are of high
frequency of use respectively, but since the logic of Decision Tree is more understandable for
business people than Neural Network, it should be a good choice for non-experts in data
mining (Ngai, Xiu, & Chau, 2009; Wei & Chiu, 2002). As Olafsson, Li, and Wu, (2008)
mentioned one of the main reasons behind their popularity appears to be their transparency,
and hence relative advantage in terms of interpretability.
Decision tree
Decision Tree is a tree-shaped structure that represents sets of decisions and is able to
generate rules for the classification of a data set (Lee & Siau, 2001) or as Berry and Linoff
(2004) noted is a structure that can be used to divide up a large collection of records into
successively smaller sets of records by applying a sequence of simple decision rules.
Whatever the technique is, it has been proven to be one of the top 3 popular techniques of
data mining in CRM (Ngai, Xiu, & Chau, 2009)
The Decision Tree technique is suitable for describing sequence of interrelated decisions or
predicting future data trends (Berry & Linoff, 2004; Chen, Hsu, & Chou, 2003; Kim, Song,
Kim, & Kim, 2005). The technique is capable of classifying specific entities into specific
classes based on feature of entities (Buckinx, Moons, Van Den Poel, & Wets, 2004; Chen,
Hsu, & Chou, 2003).

23

According to Tan, Steinbach, & Kumar (2006) each tree cosists of three types of nodes:
¾ Root Node
¾ Internal Node
¾ Leaf or Terminal Node
A record enters the tree at the root node. The root node applies a test to determine which
internal node the record will encounter next. There are different algorithms for choosing the
initial test, but the goal is always the same: To choose the test that best discriminates among
the target classes. This process is repeated until the record arrives at a leaf node. All the
records that end up at a given leaf of the tree are classified the same way, and each leaf node
is assigned a class label (Tan, Steinbach, & Kumar, 2006; Berry & Linoff, 2004).
In fact decision tree is bale to solve a classification problem b asking a series of exact
created questions about the characteristics of the test record.

The following example

provided by Tan, Steinbach, & Kumar (2006) can clarify the way a decision tree works:
Generally speaking vertebrates fall in two major categories: mammals and non-mammals.
Now for classifying a newly doscovered species into one of these groups one way is to ask a
series of questions about the attributes of the species.
1- Is the species cold blooded or warm blooded? Possible Answers: (Cold blooded: not
mammal) or (Warm blooded: it is either a bird or a mammal so question two is
necessary to be asked)
2- Do the females of the species give birth to their young? Possible answers: (Yes:
mammals) or (No: nonmammal)
Figure 2.4 illustrates the decision tree shape of the later classification procedure.

2.3.2. Clustering
Cluster analysis is an approach by which a set of instances (without a predefined class
attribute) is grouped into several clusters based only on information found in the data that
describes the objects and their relationships (Wei & Chiu, 2002; Tan, Steinbach, & Kumar,
2006). “A cluster is a collection of data objects that are similar to one another within the same
cluster and are dissimilar to the objects in other cluster” (Han & Kamber, 2006) .
While in classification the classes are defined prior to building the model, cluster analysis
divides the data based on similarity them.
There exist different types of clustering from different point of view. The most common
distinction among different types of clustering is to separate it two Partitional and
hierarchical methods.
As Tan, Steinbach, & Kumar ( 2006) defined “Partitional Clustering” is the simple division
of a set of data objects into non-overlapping segments such that each data object is in exactly
26

one segment and if we permit clusters to have sub-clusters then we obtain a “Hierarchical
Clustering”.
Among existing clustering methods TwoStep Cluster technique is a clustering algorithm
which has been designed to handle very large data sets (SPSS Inc, 2007).
TwoStep Cluster
TwoStep is a clustering technique that uses agglomerative hierarchical clustering method and
as its name implies, involves two steps (SPSS Inc, 2007):
A. Pre-Clustering
B. Clustering

Pre-cluster
Using sequential clustering approach, the pre-cluster step scans the data records one by one
and decides if the current record should be merged with the previously formed clusters or
starts a new cluster based on distance criterion.

Cluster
This step takes the resulting pre-clusters from pre-cluster step and groups them into desired
number of cluster.
TwoStep uses the hierarchical clustering method in the second step to assess multiple cluster
solutions and automatically determine the optimal number of clusters for the input data
(SPSS Inc, 2007).

2.4. Customer churn: Review of Literature
“The propensity of customers to cease doing business with a company in a given time
period” can be defined as customer churn (Chandar, Laha, & Krishna, 2006).
Companies aim at getting more and more new customers. Nevertheless, the ratio (new
customers/ churners) tends towards one over time. The impact of churn becomes then
markedly more sensitive (Lejeune, 2001).

27

According to Lejeune (2001) the concept of churn is often correlated with the industry lifecycle. When the industry is in the growth phase of its life-cycle, sales increase exponentially;
the number of new customers largely exceeds the number of churners, but for products in the
maturity phase of their life- cycle, companies put the focus on the churn rate reduction.
Customer churn figures directly in how long a customer stays with a company and, in turn,
the customer’s lifetime value (CLV) to that company (Neslin, Gupta, Kamakura, Lu, &
Mason, 2006), which is the sum of the revenues gained from company’s customers over the
lifetime of transactions after the deduction of the total cost of attracting, selling, and servicing
customers, taking into account the time value of money (Hwang, Jung, & Suh, 2004).
Previous researches have examined the concept of customer churn from different points of
view. According to Olafsson, Li, and Wu, (2008) there are two different types of churns. The
first is voluntary churn, which means that established customers choose to stop being
customers. The other type is forced churn, which refers to those established customers who
no longer are good customers and the company cancels the relationship.
Burez and Van den Poel (2008) have divided the voluntary churners to two groups:
commercial churners and financial churners. According to their research customers who
voluntary leave the company can be divided into two groups: customers who do not renew
their fixed term contract at the end of that contract, and others who just stop paying during
their contract to which they are legally bound. The first type of churn can be considered
commercial churn, i.e., customers making a studied choice not to renew their subscriptions.
The second phenomenon is defined as financial churn, people who stop paying because they
can no longer afford the service.
Nowadays Customer churn has become the main concern for firms in all industries (Neslin,
Gupta, Kamakura, Lu, & Mason, 2006), and companies, regardless of the industry that they
are active in, are dealing with this issue. Customer churn can blemish a company by
decreasing profit level, losing a great deal of price premium, and losing referrals from
continuing service customers (Reichheld & Sasser, 1990). A research by Reichheld (1996)
revealed that an increase of 5% in customer retention rate can increase the average net
present value of customer by 35% for software companies and 95% for advertising agencies.

28

Considering the churn rate of different industries, one can find that the telecommunications
industry is one of the main targets of this hazard such that the churn rate in this industry
ranges from 20 to 40 annually (Berson, Smith, & Therling, 1999; Madden, Savage, & CobleNeal, 1999). Customer churn in mobile telecommunications (often refers to customer attrition
in other industries) refers to “the movement of subscribers from one provider to another”
(Wei & Chiu, 2002).
There exist two basic approaches to manage the customer churn. Untargeted approaches
which rely on superior product and mass advertising to increase brand loyalty and retain
customers and Targeted approaches which rely on identifying customers who are likely to
churn, and then either provide them with a direct incentive or customize a service plan to
stay.
The targeted approach falls in two categories: Reactive and Proactive. Adopting a reactive
approach, a company waits until customers contact the company to cancel their (service)
relationship. The company then offers the customer an incentive, for example a rebate, to
stay. Adopting the proactive approach, the company tries to identify customers who are likely
to churn at some later date in advance. The company then targets these customers with
special programs or incentives to keep the customer from churning. Targeted proactive
programs have potential advantages of having lower incentive costs (because the incentive
may not have to be as high as when the customer has to be ‘‘bribed’’ not to leave at the last
minute) and because customers are not trained to negotiate for better deals under the threat of
churning. However, these systems can be very wasteful if churn predictions are inaccurate,
because then companies are wasting incentive money on customers who would have stayed
anyway. (Neslin, Gupta, Kamakura, Lu, & Mason, 2006; Coussement & Van den Poel, 2008)
In order to tackle this problem numerous attempts have been made to achieve an appropriate
insight toward the churn concept. In general, researches in this field have been made with one
of the following aims: finding the influential factors on customer churn, or model building for
customer churn prediction which is still of high importance (Coussement & Van den Poel,
2009).
Despite the fact that the approach and focus of this research is on extracting and designing a
predictive model for customer churn in telecommunications industry, we should bear in mind
that due to the consistence nature of churning behavior of customers in almost all industries,
29

attaining a true insight about customer churn in mobile telephony segment would be next to
impossible in the absence of knowledge regarding the churn in other industries. Considering
this fact, in this section the existing predictive models for churn in different industries have
been studied. Additionally, in order to acquire insight into underlying factors of this problem
in telecommunications industry, explanatory studies in this realm have been reviewed. In this
regard numerous of exploratory and explanatory researches have been conducted with the
aim of recognizing determinant factors that leads a customer to churn or to retain. Such
researches have roots in the fact that service attributes and demographic attributes are of
influential factors in defection of customers (Rust & Zahorik, 1993; Zeithaml, Leonard, &
Parasuraman, 1996; Li S. , 1995; Bhattacharya, 1998). Among these researches that have
been conducted in different industries some are about to find the churn drivers while the
others was about to construct a predictive model using a statistical techniques.
In (2004) Kim and Yoon investigated the underlying elements of customer churn in mobile
telecommunications service providers. From what they found we can understand that attrition
of customers in this industry depends on the level of satisfaction with alternative specific
service attributes including call quality, tariff level, handset, brand image, as well as income,
and subscription duration, but only factors such as call quality, handset type, and brand image
affect customer loyalty as has been measured by the positive word of mouth in the form of
recommendation. In other words, according to Kim and Yoon (2004) determinants of churn
clearly differ from those of loyalty and in order to decrease the churn rate in telecom industry
the company is supposed to focus on boost the satisfaction level rather than loyalty.
Gerpott, Rams, and Schindler (2001) believe that retention, loyalty and satisfaction of
customers in telecom industry are causally inter-correlated and that service price, perceived
benefits, and also lack of number portability have strong effects on customer retention. They
investigated

the influential factors on

bringing

superior

economic success for

telecommunications network operators in German market and tested the hypotheses
suggesting that Customer Retention (CR) Customer Loyalty (CL), and Customer Satisfaction
(CS) should be treated as differential constructs which are causally inter-linked. The result
shows that overall CS has a significant positive impact on CL which in turn influences a
customer’s intention to terminate / extend the contractual relationship (CR). It’s also been
revealed that mobile service price and personal service benefit perceptions as well as lack of

30

number portability between various cellular operators’ perceived customer care performance
had no considerable effect on CR.
In 2006, Ahn, Han, and Lee conducted an exploratory research in which they aimed at
finding the most influential factors on customer churn. In their research they considered a
mediator factor named “Customer’s Status”, between churn determinants and customer churn
in their model, and they’ve mentioned that “Customer’s Status” (from active use to non – use
or suspended) change is an early signal of total customer churn. In fact the main focus of this
research is on finding determinants of churn and authors have found that call quality – related
factors influence customer churn.
Figure 2.6 demonstrates four major constructs hypothesized by Ahn, Han, and Lee (2006) to
affect customer churn and the mediation effects of customer’s status that indirectly affect
customer churn.

Figure 2.6: A conceptual model for customer churn with mediation effects (Source: Ahn, Han, & Lee, 2006)

In their research a mediator named “Customer Status” has been taken into account between
churn determinants and customer churn, and it has been hypothesized that a customer’s status
change is an early signal of total customer churn.
Conducting their empirical analysis they draw a random sample of subscribers of a leading
telecommunications service provider. The account had to be active during the time period
between September 2001 and November 2001. For those customers, all accounts were
tracked and examined for 8 month from September 2001 to April 2002, and “Churn” was
defined as the event in which a subscription was terminated by the end of April 2002. In other
31

words according to the above mentioned hypotheses churn happened during the period from
December 2001 to April 2002. For churners 3-month, 2-month, and 1-month prior data was
collected before the actual termination. For the non-churners, the most recent last 3 months of
data was collected (from February 2002 to April 2002).
From the collected data they extracted the subscriber’s usage and billing data and also the
demographic data were added. The available data consisted of billed amounts, accumulated
loyalty points; call quality-related indicators, handset-related information, calling plans,
gender, etc.
In order to analyze the data and test the research questions three logistic regression adopted.
The results show that dissatisfaction indicators such as number of complaints and call drop
rate have a significant impact on the probability of churn. Besides, it has been revealed that
loyalty points such as membership card programs have a significant negative impact on the
probability of customer churn. Moreover, surprisingly the findings showed that heavy users
are more likely to churn and also customer status was found to have significant impact on the
probability of churn. In addition they found out that customer status has a significant impact
on the probability of churn. The customer’s status changes from active use to either non-use
or suspended increases the churn probability.
Delving into factors affecting customer churn Madden, Savage, and Coble-Neal (1999)
investigated customer churn in Australian Internet Service Providers (ISPs). They designed a
questionnaire asking Internet users about their Internet use and expenditure, pricing plan and
Socio-demographic background, and at the end the respondents were asked about their
intention to change their ISP within the next twelve months, and the reason of it. The results
of the research show that probability of churn is positively associated with monthly ISP
expenditure, but inversely related to household income. Furthermore the findings show that
employing flat-rate pricing can decrease the churn tendency in compare with some form of
timed usage charging structure. Besides, customers who use Internet for work related
purposes and have an account with another ISP found to be at more risk of churn. Ultimately,
the demographic factor, age, found to have significant effect on switching behavior of
subscribers.

The results show that:
1. The more complex service plan, more sophisticated handset, longer customer
association, higher connectivity quality of wireless is positively related to customer
retention behavior.
2. Different age and gender groups revealed differences in wireless connectivity quality
and service plan complexity, affecting their customer retention behavior, while they
did not experience differences in terms of length of customer association and handset
sophistication.
These results raise very interesting questions particularly that of asking why different age
and gender groups would differ on the connectivity quality of wireless service and not on
handset sophistication? So they divided the customer base into 10 groups according to their
age and gender.
And they understood that the group of females over 25-years of age was most likely to stay
with its current service provider, Customers under 26-year-olds, regardless of gender, were
most likely to churn, and Customers in all groups preferred the most sophisticated handsets.
The most unpredicted result was that the different demographic groups do actually show a
difference in connectivity quality (dropped-call ratio). This was surprising, because
connectivity quality is not related to customer taste, but is a technical aspect of wireless
service that should remain the same across different age and gender groups. However, the
group of males over 25 years old had a much higher dropped-call ratio than all other groups,
while males between 16 and 25 years old had the second highest dropped-call ratio. One
possible conjecture is that males are more mobile than females. A dropped call happens most
in handovers, when one cell-center hands over its users to another cell-center as they move
from one area to another. This means that customers who are more mobile have a greater
chance of experiencing dropped calls.
Additionally their research revealed that ales are more likely to have more complex service
plans than females. Older customers tended to have more complex service plans as well,
which sounds logical because heavy users like working people tend to have more complex
plans.

34

The findings of Seo, Ranganathan, & Babad (2008)’s study contribute to the literature in
three ways. First, they showed a strong relationship between switching costs and customer
retention behavior. Accordingly, they understood that service plan complexity, reflecting
price and wireless service usage, and handset sophistication can increase switching costs,
which are positively related to customer retention behavior. Secondly, they confirmed once
again the importance of technical performance in customer retention behavior. The
fundamental quality characteristic of wireless service, connectivity quality, does affect
customer retention behavior. Thirdly, the study reveals how age and gender demographics
can affect customer retention behavior indirectly. These groups differ with respect to service
plan complexity and connectivity of wireless service but are similar in terms of length of stay
and handset sophistication, which lead to varying retention behavior.
Despite the efforts which have been made in order to utilize the statistical techniques for
constructing the models for customer churn prediction, it is needless to say that model
building for churn prediction is strongly dependent on machine learning techniques due to the
better performance of machine learning techniques than the statistical techniques for nonparametric dataset (Baesens, Viaene, Van den Poel, Vanthienen, & Dedene, 2002;
Bhattacharyya & Pendharkar, 1998)
Based on previous researches on churn prediction, Wei and Chiu (2002) developed a new
model for customer churn prediction in telecommunication service providers by using data
mining techniques. In that time, past researches on churn prediction in the
telecommunications industry mainly had employed classification analysis techniques for the
construction of churn prediction models and they had used user demographics, contractual
data, customer service logs and call patterns extracted from call details (e.g. average call
duration, number of outgoing calls, etc.), but Wei and Chiu believed that existing churn –
prediction model had several disadvantages. They listed the disadvantages in two groups;
first, use of customer demographics in churn prediction renders the resulting churn analysis at
the customer rather than contract (or subscriber) level. In other words, tendency of each
customer toward churning was calculated on a per-customer rather than contract basis. It is
quite common that a customer concurrently holds several mobile service contracts with
particular carrier, with some contracts more likely to be churned than others. In this regard,
customer – level – based churn prediction is considered inappropriate. Second, information

35

on some of the input variables (features) was not readily available and this unavailability of
customer profiles, had been limited the applicability of existing churn – prediction systems.
In response to the described limitations of existing churn – prediction systems in that time,
Wei and Chiu exploited the use of call pattern changes and contractual data for developing a
churn – prediction techniques that identifies potential churners at the contract level. They
claimed that subscribers’ churn is not an instantaneous occurrence that leaves no trace.
Before an existing subscriber churn, his/her call patterns might be changed (e.g. the number
of outgoing calls gradually gets reduced). In other words, changes in call patterns are likely to
include warning signals pointing toward churning. Such call pattern changes can be extracted
from subscribers’ call details and are valuable for constructing a churn prediction model
based on a classification analysis technique. In their investigation they used two types of
available data: Contractual data including length of services, payment type, contract type, and
Call details such as Minutes of Use (MOU), Frequency of Use (FOU) and Sphere of
Influence (SOI: refers to the total number of distinct receivers contacted by the subscriber
over a specific period) in order to develop a churn prediction technique.
Using the data set Wei and Chiu (2002) randomly selected a prediction period (P) in order to
generate an evaluation data set and also determine the churn status. According to them churn
status of a subscriber was the connected or disconnected status of the subscriber within the
prediction period P, and subscribers who disconnected his/her mobile service during P were
considered as churner while the ones who disconnected the service before P were not
included in their evaluation data set. Furthermore subscribers who were still connected to the
service provider at the end of P classified as non-churner.
After determining the prediction period, the authors considered a retention period (R)
immediately prior to P and the call records from this period were not used for churn
prediction model construction. Moreover prior to R, an observation period (T) was specified
and the required data for extracting the call pattern changes were employed from this period.
Anyone whose contract started no earlier than the observation period T was excluded from
the evaluation dataset. In brief their aim can be defined as the employing the call details of
subscriber usage in observation period T to predict their churn status in prediction period P.
Representing call pattern changes of a subscriber during a specific observation period (T),
the authors divided the T period into several sub-periods of equal duration. Then they
36

modeled the call pattern change of a subscriber by considering the change rate of each
measure between any two consecutive sub-periods. The variable used to signify the call
pattern changes of a subscriber consist of:
)

1. MOU of a subscriber in the first sub-period (
2. FOU of a subscriber in the first sub-period (
3. SOI of a subscriber in the first sub-period (
4. ∆

)
)

: The change in MOU of a subscriber between the sub-period s-1 and s (for

s=2,3,…..,n) and is measured by ∆
where
5. ∆

and

/
0.01.

: The change in FOU of a subscriber between the sub-period s-1 and s (for
/

s=2,….,n) and is calculated as ∆
6. ∆

: The change in SOI of a subscriber between the sub-period s-1 and s (for

s=2,….,n) and calculated as ∆

/

.

As it is clear, the number of sub-periods and the duration of each sub period are reversely
related to each other and the increase of each one causes the decrease of the other one. Thus
choosing the appropriate number of sub-periods was one of the major concerns of authors.
Developing the churn prediction model they considered a set of subscribers as training
instances and described them by the above mentioned input variables and labeled them to
indicate the user’s churn status.
Employing decision tree as their modeling technique and Detection Error Tradeoff (DET)
curve as their evaluation criteria Wei and Chiu (2002) took their steps toward building their
churn prediction model.
In their model building phase they tested the role of different variables such as desired class
ratio, number of sub-periods in observation period, and length of retention period on accuracy
of model. The initial result showed that the desired hit ratio equal to 1:2 and the number of
sub-period equal to 2 can leverage the model accuracy to its optimum level. Moreover they
built two models based on hit ratio=1:2 and number of sub-periods = 2. With two different
lengths for retention period (i.e. 7 and 14 days for model 1 and model 2 respectively) in order
to test the effect of Retention period on model’s accuracy.

37

3.

Model 1: R=7days
9 Identified 10.03% of the subscribers that contained 54.33% of true churners (Lift
factor =5.42)
9 Identified 20% of the subscribers that contained 64.72% of true churners (Lift factor =
3.24
9 Identified 29.68% of the subscribers that contained 72.16% of true churners (Lift
factor = 2.43)

4.

Model 2: R=14
9 Identified 10.03% of the subscribers that contained 46.95% of true churners (Lift
factor = 4.68)
9 Identified 19.65% of the subscribers that contained 57.58% of true churners (Lift
factor = 2.93)
9 Identified 28.32% of the subscribers that contained 65.07% of the true churners (
Lift factor = 2.30)

As it is presented above the first model out performs the second one and clearly both models
have better performance in compare with an untargeted effort. (See figure 2.8)

Figure 2.8: Lift chart attained by the proposed churn – prediction technique (source: Wei and Chiu, 2002).

As another approach Yan, Fassino and Baldasare (2005) tried to construct a predictive model
for customer churn in pre-paid customer segment in mobile telephony market and due to the
limited availability of data in prepaid customer segment, they exploited Call Detail Record
(CDR). In order to construct their predictive model, the authors extracted the calling links i.e.
who called whom as inputs to a neural network model and achieved an acceptable accuracy
in their predictive model.
38

Using the CDR, they defined two categories of calling links as follows:
1. Direct calling neighbor: A person who calls the customer or whom the customer
calls.
2. Indirect calling neighbor: A person who calls the same numbers as the customer
does.
Utilizing these neighbors they discovered the calling community of each customer and
hypothesized that people from a calling community behave in a similar way. So they
supposed that if a customer’s most frequently called parties churned from the same service
provider, the customer may eventually churn also.
With the intention of building the churn predictive model they used the CDR data of July
and August so that predict the churn in December. As it is clear they considered a 3 month
gap between the observation and prediction period. In addition, they were provided with
churn labels i.e. who churned, in both November and December. In fact their research’s task
was to develop a churn prediction model, with churn in December as the dependent variable
(Prediction Target) and two independent variable including: the CDR data in July and August
and the churn information in November.
Then they analyzed the data by using decision tree and neural networks and understood that
for the neural network, if the customer service representatives contact the 10% of customers
with the highest scores from the model, they are able to correctly identify 20% of the
churners. By random sampling, the lift curve is the diagonal line. Also they understood that
the neural networks outperform the decision tree, which performs even worse than random
sampling for a higher contact rate (figure 2.9).
The evaluation of the model was based on lift curve with the following axis:
•

Y-Axis: True Positive Rate

•

X-Axis: Customer Contact Rate

of first order distance, while the short-dashed line is for the neural network model using features based on both
first and second order distances. The dotted line is based on boosting decision trees. (Source: Yan, Fassino, &
Baldasare, 2005)

As another effort on predicting customer churn in telecommunications companies Hung,
Yen, and Wang (2006), compared different data mining techniques that can be utilized in
order to build a model for churn prediction. Using the lift factor as the criterion model
performance evaluation, the authors compared the performance of Decision- Tree without
segmentation, Decision-Tree with segmentation, and Neural-Network in building a model for
churn prediction.
The study concentrates on post-paid subscribers who were activated for at least 3 months
prior to July 1, 2001, and the “churner” was defined as a subscriber who is voluntary to leave
and a non-churner is the one who is still using the specified operator service.
The authors used the latest 6 months (July-June) transaction data of each subscriber to
predict the churn probability in the following month. As the input variables of their model
they extracted the following variables from other researches and interviews with experts:

40



Customer Demography
•

Age: analysis shows that the customers between 45 and 48 have a higher propensity
to churn than population’s churn rate.

•

Tenure: customers with 25 – 30 months tenure have a high propensity to churn. A
possible cause is that most subscription plans have a 2-year contract period.

•

Gender: churn probability for corporate accounts is higher than others. A possible
cause is that when employees quit, they lose corporate subsidy in mobile services.



Bill and payment analysis
•

Monthly fee: the churn probability is higher for customers with a monthly fee less
than $100 NT or between $520 and $550.

•

Billing amount: the churn probability tends to be higher for customers whose average
billing amount over 6 months is less than or equal to $190 NT.

•

Count of overdue payment: the churn probability is higher for customers with less
than four counts of overdue payments in the past 6 months. In Taiwan, if the payment
is 2 months overdue, the mobile operator will most likely suspend the mobile service
until fully paid. This may cause customer dissatisfaction and churn.



Call detail records analysis
•

In-net call duration: customers who don’t often make phone calls to others in the
same operator’s mobile network are more likely to churn. In-net unit price is
relatively lower than that of other call types. Price-sensitive subscribers may leave for
the mobile operator his/her friends use.

•

Call type: customers who often make PSTN or IDD calls are more likely to churn
than those who make more mobile calls.



Customer care/service analysis
•

MSISDN change count: customers who have changed their phone number or made
two or more changes in account information are more likely to churn.

•

Count of bar and suspend: customers who have ever been barred or suspended are
more likely to churn. In general, a subscriber will be barred or suspended by the
mobile operators due to overdue payments.

Using the above mentioned variables, Hung, Yen, and Wang (2006) adopted the following
three approaches toward model building for customer defection prediction:
41

a) Decision-Tree with segmentation:
by the use of K-Means Cluster technique and variables such as bill amount, tenure,
MOU (outbound call usage), MTU (inbound call usage), and payment rate, they
clustered the customer base to five clusters and the Decision-Three was constructed in
each of these five customer segments
b) Decision-Tree without segmentation:
The tree was built for all customers of a single cluster
c) Neural Network (Back Propagation Network, BPN)
The results depicted that the Decision-Tree model without segmentation outperforms the
Decision-Tree model with segmentation. Besides, the outcomes show that BPN based model
posses a better performance than the two other models.
As it has been mentioned before in chapter one, the RFM model which is proposed and
developed by Ansari, Kohavi, Mason, & Zheng (2000), is one of the major approaches
toward predcting the probability of churn and retention. In accordance with Fader, Hardie &
Lee (2005), a customer past behavior is an important predictor for one’s future behavior and
indeed RFM model has considered to be the model based on past behavior and as you may
considered, up to this point most churn prediction models were basically based on input data
from RFM plus some additional information such as demographic or transactional data. In
other words most built models were the same but the utilized techniques differentiated them
from each other. In contrast with most of the above mentioned predictive models,
Coussement & Van den Poel (2008) developed a predictive model for customer churn by
adding the “Voice of Customers” (VOC) to the independent variables of their model.
They used data from a large Belgian newspaper publishing company in a time period from
January 2002 to September 2005, and extracted two renewal time between July 2004 and July
2005. Furthermore they defined a churner as a person who did not renew his/her contract in a
4-week period after maturity date.
Conducting this study, the authors extracted the information from emails as the Voice of
Customers by the use of text mining (a process of deriving high-quality information from
text) and used it as a feature, in addition to other structured marketing information i.e. all
transactional and marketing related information, in order to build their the prediction model.

42

Thus, the built model exploited two types of data as its independent variables. The first type
of data includes, the information from the structured marketing database such as
Client/Company interaction variables, Subscription related variables, renewal specific
variables, and Socio-demographics. The second type of independent data consists of all
information sent by the subscriber via email during the last period of his/her subscription.
Using Logistic Regression as the data mining technique and lift factor and Area Under the
receiving operating Curve (AUC), as the evaluation criteria, Coussement & Van den Poel
(2008a) conducted their model building phase and the analysis results came out to show that
combining the unstructured information from emails with other RFM (Recency, Frequency
and Monetary) features can cause an increase from 73.80 to 77.75 in AUC and from 2.69 to
3.07 in lift factor in the first decile.
Continuing their previous research Coussement & Van den Poel (2009) tested the
performance of different classifiers on the similar data in order to choose the best performing
classification technique, in addition to testing the model enhancement by relying on customer
information. Indeed, the aim of this study was to contribute to the literature by finding the
proof that adding emotions in client/company emails increases the predictive performance of
an RFM churn model and also compare the performance of three classification techniques i.e.
Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests to distinguish
churners from non- churners.
Thus, by defining “Extended RFM” (eRFM) model as a RFM model which also includes
other information such as demographic or other transactional data. Coussement & Van den
Poel (2008b) put one step ahead and extended the eRFM model by adding client/company
interaction email data which includes the emotional aspect of clients toward the company and
called it “eRFM-EMO”.
Using data from a news paper company and the time window same as their previous
research (Coussement & Van den Poel, 2008) for observation and prediction and Percentage
Correctly Classified (PCC) and the Area Under the receiving operating Curve (AUC) as their
evaluation criteria, they applied SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests on the data.
The results show that an eRFM-EMO model always (with all three tested techniques) has a
higher predictive performance in compare with the eRFM model. It has also revealed that
implementing Random Forests is an opportunity to improve the predictive performance and
its performance is always significantly higher than the performance of Logistic Regression
and SVM.

Furthermore, the study found no significant relationship between positive

expressed emotions in information requests and someone’s churn. Besides, negative
43

expressed emotions in information requests seems to be influential on customers’ churning
behavior. To be more specific, according to this research, one can say that the more negative
emotional words are used in emails other than complaints, the lower the chance that the
customer will churn and also it has been concluded that the more complaints a customer has
in her/his emails sent to the company, the more certain he/she stays with the company.
In the same year another research conducted by Pendharkar, for churn prediction in
telecommunications industry, using Genetic Algorithm (GA) based Neural Network
(Pendharkar, 2009). The authors designed two GA based Neural Network model. One by
using cross entropy based criterion and the other one with direct approach.
They compared these two proposed model with a statistical z-score model and concluded
that both above mentioned models outperform the statistical z-score model. Furthermore it’s
been proven that the cross entropy based criterion may be more resistant to overfitting outlier
in training dataset.
Conducting the process of model building, the pendharkar (2008) used the following
features:
•

Subscriber ID Number

•

Billing Month

•

Subscription Plan

•

Monthly Total Peak Usage in Minutes

•

Promotional Mailing Variable

•

Churn Indicator

For his Neural Network classification model, he excluded Subscriber ID Number and
Billing Month and considered subscription plan, monthly total usage in minutes, , and
promotional mailing variable as inputs and churn variable as the output variable. Regarding
this, he split the original set of 195,956 examples into five train and test pair (70%-30%
respectively) randomly and for Neural Network model and pair of datasets they performed
three different tests with different number of nodes in the hidden layer (i.e. Three, six, and
nine).
The final results showed that Neural Networks models dominated the z-score model in all
aspects while both Neural Network models have the same performance. Furthermore the
study revealed the point that medium sized Neural Network (i.e. the one with 6 nodes in
hidden layer) posses the optimum performance (Pendharkar, 2009).

44

Mining with rarity
Considering all researches conducted by having a focus on churn prediction, one can discover
a common problem among them. The problem with churn analysis derives from the specific
nature of churn prediction (Xie, Li, Ngai, & Ying, 2009). As Zhao, Li, Li, Liu, & Ren (2005),
Au, Chan, & Yao (2003) and Shah (1996) have noted, we can name three major
characteristics for churn prediction as follow:
1. The data is usually imbalanced and the number of churners constitutes only a very
small minority of the data
2. Large learning applications will have some type of noise in the data
3. Churn prediction requires the ranking of subscribers according to their likelihood to
churn
Among these three, the problem of imbalanced data is becoming the focal point of most
studies in this realm during recent years (Burez & Van den Poel, 2009).
Since the customer churn is often a rare event in service industries, nearly all datasets by
which the predictive models are built are imbalanced (i.e. the number of churners is
considerably lower than the non-churners) (Burez & Van den Poel, 2009). And due to this
issue six mining problems may arise (Weiss, 2004):
1. Improper evaluation metrics:
2. Lack of data (absolute rarity)
3. Relative lack of data (relative rarity)
4. Data fragmentation
5. Inappropriate inductive bias
6. Noise
Coping with these problems different approaches have been adopted by experts. As
mentioned before Wei & Chiu (2002) used multi-classifier class combiner their approach to
tackle the relative rarity problem and they showed that under sampling the data and working
with data with hit ratio of 1:2 (churner : non-churner) can help to improve the model’s
accuarcy.
According to Weiss (2004) there are ten solutions to the aforementioned problems:
1. Using more appropriate evaluation metrics
2. Non-greedy search techniques
3. Using a more appropriate inductive bias
4.

Knowledge/Human interaction
45

5. Segmenting the data
6. Learn only the rare class
7. Accounting for rare item
8. Sampling
9. Cost-sensitive learning
10. Other methods such as boosting, placing rare cases into sepaaret classes, and two
phase rule induction
Based on the study by Weiss (2004) , Burez & Van den Poel (2008b) have put 4 of the
above mentioned solutions into practice and tested the performance of them for handling the
imbalance in customer churn prediction. They used appropriate evaluation metrics such as
AUC and lift curve as their evaluation metrics, cost-sensitive learning such as Weighted
Random Forests, basic and advanced smpling methods such as under sampling, over
sampling, and CUBE ( (Deville & Tille, 2004) and boosting in order to buid a model with
better performance.
Reults revealed that, regarding the evaluation metrics, both AUC and lift curve showed
acceptable performance but since AUC has the advantage of being dependent on the churn
rate, it would be more appropriate to be used for evaluation of churn prediction models.
Furthermore resluts dipicted that under-sampling can lead to improved predictive accuracy
especially when evaluated with AUC but the advaned sampling techniques CUBE found to
cause no increase in predictive performance. Additionally, according to Burez & Van den
Poel (2009)’s findings the Weighted Random Forests, as a cost-sensitive learner, has a
significantly better performance compared to Random Forests.
Moreover and as another attempt regarding the handling the data imbalance, Xie, Li, Ngai,
& Ying, (2008) used a combination of wighted and balaced Random Forests ,called improved
balanced Random Forests, and they concluded that their proposed technique significantly
outperforms the other standard methods, namely Artificial Naural Network, Decision Tree,
and Support Vector Machine (See figur 2.10 and figure 2.11).

46

Figure 2.10: Lift curve of different random forests algorithms (Source: Xie, Li, Ngai, & Ying, 2009)

Figure 2.11: Lift curve of different algorithms (Source: Xie, Li, Ngai, & Ying, 2009)

As mentioned before recently applying cost-sensitive methods, has emerged among experts
as a remedy for handling the class imbalance in churn datasets (Burez & Van den Poel, 2009;
Xie, Li, Ngai, & Ying, 2009).
“Cost-sensitive learning methods can take advantage of the fact that the value of correctly
identifying the rare class outweighs the value of correctly identifying the common class. For
two-class problems this is done by associating a greater cost with false negatives than with
false positives which leads to improving the model’s performance with respect to the rare
class (Weiss, 2004).

47

According to Ling and Sheng (2008) different costs such as costs of false positive (actual
negative but predicted as positive; denoted as FP), false negative (FN), true positive (TP) and
true negative (TN), in cost-sensitive learning can be given in a cost matrix similar to table 2.2
Table 2.2: An example of cost matrix for binary classification.

Where

,

Actual negative

Actual positive

C(1,1), or TP

is considered as the benefit and the rare class is regarded as the positive class

and it is often more expensive to misclassify an actual positive example into negative, than an
actual negative example into positive. In other words the costs imposed by FN or

0,1 is

1,0 . As Ling and Sheng (2008) mentioned

always larger than the costs imposed by FP or

according to the cost matrix an example should be classified into the class with the minimum
expected cost. This is the minimum expected cost principle. The expected cost R(i|x) of
classifying an instance x into class (by a classifier) can be expressed as:

R i|x

P j|x C j, i

Where P(j|x) is the probability estimation of classifying an instance into class j. That is, the
classifier will classify an instance x into positive class if and only if:
P(0|x)C(1,0) + P(1|x)C(1,1) ≤ P(0|x)C(0,0) + P(1|x)C(0,1)
This is equivalent to

48

P(0|x)(C(1,0) – C(0,0)) ≤ P(1|x)(C(0,1) – C(1,1))
Thus, the decision (of classifying an example into positive) will not be changed if a
constant is added into a column of the original cost matrix. Thus, the original cost
matrix can always be converted to a simpler one by subtracting C(0,0) to the first
column, and C(1,1) to the second column. After such conversion, the simpler cost
matrix is shown in Table 2.3. Thus, any given cost-matrix can be converted to one
with C(0,0) = C(1,1) = 0. In the rest of the paper, we will assume that C(0,0) = C(1,1)
= 0. Under this assumption, the classifier will classify an instance x into positive class
if and only if:
P(0|x)C(1,0) ≤ P(1|x)C(0,1)
Table 2.3: A simpler cost matrix with an equivalent optimal classification

True negative

Predict negative

C(0,1) – C(1,1)

Predict positive

As P(0|x) = 1 – P(1|x), we can obtain a threshold
instance x into positive if P(1|x) ≥

for the classifier to classify an

, where
1,0

0,1

Thus, if a cost-insensitive classifier can produce a posterior probability estimation
p(1|x) for test examples x, we can make it cost-sensitive by simply choosing the
classification threshold according to (2), and classify any example to be positive
whenever P(1|x) ≥

. This is what most of cost-sensitive learning methods based on.

2.5. Summary
In the later chapter after reviewing the basic concepts regarding the Customer
Relationship Management (CRM) and locating the IT based or analytical CRM in its
scale and clarifying its importance, we introduced data mining as an advanced
machine learning approach which is applicable in Customer relationship management
realm. Afterwards the significant studies regarding the customer churn from both
descriptive and predictive point of view were reviewed. At the end the issue of data
imbalance in churn datasets was discussed and remedies for it were extracted from the
previous studies. As it was obvious, almost all predictive models that have been
developed in this realm were utilized all or some of the RFM variables as their input
variables for model building (Wei & Chiu, 2002; Coussement & Van den Poel, 2008;
Hung, Yen, & Wang, 2006; Coussement & Van den Poel, 2009). Conducting our
study we also followed our antecedents’ procedure and utilized the RFM features of
our customer base as the input variables in clustering phase and afterwards we
tailored the behavioral variables proposed by Wei & Chiu (2002) in order to build our
predictive model.

Chapter 3 Research Methodology
3.1. Introduction
The research design is a framework for conducting marketing research (Malhotra,
2007). Thus it’s the basic plan for conducting the data collection and analysis phase.
In the current chapter firstly the design of the research will be explained and
scrutinized and afterwards the process of executing the designed research will be
illustrated and explained.

3.2. Research Design
3.2.1. Research purpose
Studies generally fall into the following three categories: Descriptive, Explanatory
(causal), and Exploratory (Saunders, Lewis, & Thornhill, 2000).
The primary purpose of exploratory research is to shed light on the nature of a
situation and identify any specific objectives or data needs to be addressed through
additional research. Exploratory research is most useful when a decision maker
wishes to better understand a situation and/or identify decision alternatives.
Exploration is particularly useful when researchers lack a clear idea of the problems
they will meet during the study. The object of descriptive studies is to describe market
51

characteristics or functions (Malhotra, 2007). Describe is to make complicated things
understandable by reducing them to their component parts. Descriptive research could
be in direct connection to exploratory research, since researchers might have started
off by wanting gain insight to a problem, and after having stated it their research
becomes descriptive (Saunders, Lewis, & Thornhill, 2000). Explanatory studies
establish causal relationship between variables. In these studies the emphasis is on
studying a situation or a problem in order to explain the relationships between
variables (Saunders, Lewis, & Thornhill, 2000).
Based on the definition given for data mining, such approach aims at describing the
process of discovering knowledge from databases stored in data warehouses. The
purpose of data mining is to identify valid, novel, useful, and ultimately
understandable patterns in data. Data mining is a useful tool, an approach that
combines exploration and discovery with confirmatory analysis. Since the focus of
this study is data mining, thus the purpose of this research is exploratory.

3.2.2. Research approach
3.2.2.1. Qualitative Vs. Quantitative Research
Quantitative research is an inquiry into an identified problem, based on testing a
theory, measured with numbers, and analyzed using statistical techniques. The goal of
quantitative methods is to determine whether the predictive generalizations of a
theory hold true. On the other hand qualitative research is often a broad term that
describes research focusing on how individuals and groups view and understand the
world and construct meaning out of experiences. Some researchers consider it simply
to be research whose goal is not to estimate statistical parameters but to generate
hypothesis that can be tested quantitatively.
Malhotra (2007) has briefly compared the quantitative and qualitative research
approaches as it is illustrated in table 3.1

With this regard the current study falls in quantitative category which uses data
mining (a series of sophisticated statistical algorithms in order to build the predictive
model for customer churn in telecommunications industry.
3.2.2.2. Inductive vs. Deductive research
Regarding the approach, researches can be divided to two groups: inductive
(Bottom – up) research and deductive (Top – Down) research. While in a deductive
approach the research strategy is designed to test the hypotheses (or hypothesis) based
on a Pre-developed theory, the role of an inductive research is the production of a
theory from specific observations (Saunders, Lewis, & Thornhill, 2000). In other
words deductive research works from the general to the specific whereas inductive
research works from specific observations to broader generalizations and theories.
This research pursues inductive/deductive approach by studying, developing a model
for customer churn prediction in telecom service providers for a specific telecom
service provider by the use of train data and then testing and revising the initial
model, using test data which both test and train data have been generated by the users.

53

3.2.3. Research strategy
Research strategy is a general plan of how researcher will go about answering
research question (Saunders, Lewis, & Thornhill, 2000).
This strategy contains clear objectives, derived from the research question(s),
sources from which the data are intended to be collected and the possible constraints
(Saunders, Lewis, & Thornhill, 2000)
Generally two categories of data can be utilized in researches: primary and secondary
data. Primary data are originated by a researcher for the specific purpose of
addressing the problem at hand. Secondary data are data that have already been
generated and collected for purposes other than the problem at hand. Secondary data
include data generated within an organization, information made available by
business and government sources, commercial marketing research firms and
computerized databases. Secondary data can be classified as internal and external.
The internal data are those generated within the organization for which the research is
being conducted and the external data are those generated by sources outside the
organization (Malhotra, 2007). Internal Secondary data were gathered from Talia
Co.'s database for this study. Since the aim of this thesis is data mining and data were
collected from service providers's databases, the strategy, which fits this study is a
secondary data analysis.

3.3.1. Data collection
The examined data of this research is the call records of Talia Co., which has been
gathered and stored in Oracle data base software. Since telecom company’s data base
is a dynamic one that is being updated and extended every second, the call records’
data base is a huge data base with millions and thousands million of records.

3.3.2. Data selection
The working data of this research is extracted from the Talia data base in a period of
3 months from 1 November 2007 to 31 January 2008 and it contains the call records
of 34523 customers of Talia Company. The number of records is 19500504. Among
various data types that are being saved and gathered in Talia’s database we extracted
the following one in order to utilize them in building the required and targeted
features:
9 Date of Call
9 Time of call
9 Duration of call
9 Incoming call / Outgoing call

3.3.3. Data Pre-Processing
Since the working data has been produced and recorded by machine and contains call
records information we did not face with the problem of noisy data or missing value
in our dataset.

The only pre-processing phase that we went through was data

integration. Since the data was given in three individual (TXT) files in the preprocessing phase we needed to integrate them in one single database so, data
integration was conducted and the whole data was gathered in a single database in
Microsoft SQL Server.

3.3.4. Data Transformation
In this stage the raw data that had been extracted from the data base (as discussed in
data selection and data processing part) was exploited in feature building.
56

The problematic side of this calculation was different fees that are being applied to
phone calls in different times of a day and also in different days of a week. Based on
costs that the Talia Company has considered for its services, each phone call that be
made in the time period between 9 p.m and 8 a.m or on Fridays and holidays costs
536 Rials per Minute and each phone call that be made in the time period from 8 a.m
to 9 p.m costs 670 Rials per Minute. Thus in order to calculate the cost of each
outgoing phone call we considered the time of it and the day of it ( whether it is
holiday or not) and made the “Cost” variable.
The features that we built in the process of transforming the data were recognized
and selected in accordance with the previous literature of churn prediction in
telecommunications service providers (Wei & Chiu, 2002; Coussement & Van den
Poel, 2009; Hung, Yen, & Wang, 2006) and also RFM related features. The reason
behind choosing these studies as our foundation of feature construction is that due to
the nature of pre-paid service providers our focus was on constructing features that
are able to reflect the changes in usage behavior and among the reviewed researches
the abovementioned ones (especially the one conducted by Wei & Chiu, 2002)
appropriately satisfies this need.

3.3.5. Data Mining
The data mining phase was conducted in two steps and in these steps both descriptive
and predictive data mining techniques were utilized.
Firstly, the customer base was clustered based on their usage behavioral feature
(RFM). In order to cluster our customer base according to their usage behavior we
utilized TwoStep Cluster method.
In the second step and for executing the predictive data mining approach,
classification technique was utilized. Classification is the process of finding a model
(or function) that describes and distinguishes data classes or concepts, for the purpose
of being able to use the model to predict the class of objects whose class label is
unknown. The derived model is based on the analysis of a set of training data (i.e.,
data objects whose class label is known), (Han & Kamber, 2006). Also we can define
the classification as “examining the features of a newly presented object and assigning
it to one of a predefined set of classes” (Berry & Linoff, 2004). The objective of the
57

classification is to first analyze the training data and develop an accurate description
or a model for each class using the attributes available in the data. Such class
descriptions are then used to classify future independent test data or to develop a
better description for each class (Weiss and Kulikowski, 1991; cited by Olafsson, Li,
& Wu, 2008).
Many techniques have been adopted for classification and prediction, including
decision tree induction, support vector machines (SVM), neural networks, and
Bayesian networks. Among the existing classification method we chose to use
Decision Tree due to its ease of interpretation and more understandable logic (Wei &
Chiu, 2002; Ngai, Xiu, & Chau, 2009).

3.3.6. Interpretation/ Evaluation
According to the model’s output we can measure its accuracy. There exists a broad
choice of evaluation metrics for the predictive models which have been built by data
mining techniques and each one possesses its pros and cons. Since our data suffers
from class imbalance and the field of our research is marketing, in this research we
have evaluated our developed models by using Gain Chart (Lift Curve) based on what
Burez & Van den Poel, ( 2008b) proposed. It gives a graphical interpretation of what
percentage of customers one has to target to reach a certain percentage of all churners.
An example given by Berry & Linoff (2004) may helps to explain better. Suppose that
we are building a model to predict who is likely to respond to a direct mail
solicitation. As usual, we build the model using a pre-classified training dataset. Now
we are ready to use the test set to calculate the model’s lift (Gain). The classifier
scores the records in the test set as either “predicted to respond” or “not predicted to
respond.” If the test set contains 5 percent actual responders and the sample contains
50 percent actual responders, the model provides a lift of 10 (50 divided by 5). The
gain charts (Figure 3.2) is created by sorting all the prospects according to their
likelihood of responding as predicted by the model. As the size of the mailing list
increases, we reach farther and farther down the list. The X-axis shows the percentage
of the population getting our mailing. The Y-axis shows the percentage of all
responders we reach.

58

If no model were used, mailing to 10 percent of the population would reach 10
percent of the responders, mailing to 50 percent of the population would reach 50
percent of the responders, and mailing to everyone would reach all the responders.
This mass-mailing approach is illustrated by the line slanting upwards. The other
curve shows what happens if the model is used to select recipients for the mailing.
The model finds 20 percent of the responders by mailing to only 10 percent of the
population. Soliciting half the population reaches over 70 percent of the responders.

Chapter 4 Analysis & Result
4.1. Introduction
In this chapter the detailed procedure of model building has been and its results in
each step has been brought. Furthermore in order to improve the model’s performance
I have tested the methods proposed in the literature for handling the class imbalance
and reported its outcome.

4.2. A Dual-Step Model for Churn Prediction
With the intention of constructing a classification model which is capable of
predicting the churners in pre-paid mobile telephony market segment the first task is
to define the “Churn” and “Churner” so that we can label churners from non-churners.
Due to the nature of this segment of market which is pre-paid and non-contract based
giving an appropriate definition for churn is the initial step prior to the model building
phase. Thus, regarding this fact with the purpose of model construction under such
circumstances two steps have to be taken:
¾ Step 1: Defining the churn
¾ Step 2: Constructing the Predictive Model

60

4.2.1. Step 1: Churn Definition
The major hurdle that we faced with prior to the model building phase was to giving
a logical definition for churn. In almost all studies that we reviewed in the literature
review phase, the customers of the service provider were its subscribers who had a
contract with the company. Consequently, “Churn” in such conditions could be
defined as the terminating the contract from customer’s side or not renewing it after
its

expiry

date,

But

circumstances

would

be

different

about

pre-paid

telecommunications service providers. In such companies there is no contract between
the company and the clients. Anyone can simply purchase the SIM Card and become
a user. On the other hand, any customers at any time can just stop using the provided
services by the company, and become a churner without leaving an immediate trace.
In other words churn in such cases happens with no tracking point such as terminating
the contract or not renewing it and its recognition becomes complicated.
To shed light on the issue, imagine a data base of customers consisting a number of
customers with different calling behaviors some of them use their cell phone every
day, but the others use it every 2, 3,… or 20 days. Now if we define a churner as “A
person who has not used his/her cell phone for 7 days” a considerable part of our
customers who use their cell phone occasionally (i.e. every 8, 9,….., 20 days) would
be considered as a “churner”, mistakenly. On the other hand if we take a longer time
span for prediction period and define a churner as “A person who hasn’t used his/her
cell phone for 25 days” our model may suffer from inability in recognizing the real
churners.
The above discussed wrong signals would increase the number of False Negatives
(FN) and False Positives (FP) and consequently lower the level of model’s accuracy.
Tackling this problem, I tailored the RFM features defined by Ansari, Kohavi,
Mason, & Zheng (2000) and constructed the following set of 12 RFM related
variables, which has been extracted from customers’ calling records data by the use of
Microsoft SQL Server software, in order to segment the customer base, based on their
calling behavior:
1. Call Ratio: proportion of calls which has been made by each customer with
more than one day time distance to his/her total number of calls.
61

2. Average Call Distance: the average time distance between one’s calls
3. Max Date: the last date in our observed time period in which a call has been
made by a specific customer
4. Min Date: the first date in our observed time period in which a call has been
made by a specific customer
5. Life: the period of time in our observed time span in which each customer
has been active
6. Max-Distance: the maximum time distance between two calls of an specific
person in our observed period
7. No-of-days: number of days in which a specific customer has made or
received a call
8. Total-no-in: the total number of incoming calls for each client in our
observed period
9. Total-no-out: the total number of outgoing calls for each client in our
observed period
10. Total-cost: the total money that each customer has been charged for using
the services in the specific time period under study
11. Total-duration-in: the total duration of incoming calls (in Sec) for a specific
customer in our observed time span
12. Total-duration-out: the total duration of outgoing calls

(in Sec) for a

specific customer in our observed time span
By the use of TwoStep Cluster technique the customer based was divided into 6
individual clusters with the following specifications (see table 4.1):

Among all utilized features in clustering phase, we found Max-Distance to be a
suitable representative for normal usage frequency of the customers. This feature for
each cluster addresses that, in what time distance the majority of cluster members uses
their mobile phone and thus provides us with the regular usage behavior of customers.
Consequently by having the routine manner of clients we would be able to spot any
deviation from the standard and determine a definition for deviation with an
acceptable approximation. Table 4.2 has summarized the Max-Distance feature for all
extracted clusters:

By looking at the extracted clusters from Max-Distance point of view we reach to 4
clusters out of these 6 clusters. So we redesigned the clusters as depicted in table 4.3,
and by considering the “Prediction Period” as twice the Max-Distance, we defined the
Prediction, Retention, and Observation as illustrated in table 4.4 for each cluster based
on Wei & Chiu ( 2002)’s definition.

4.2.2. Step 2: Constructing the Predictive Model
As the second step, by considering two sub-periods of 15 days in the observation
period (Wei & Chiu (2002) in their study tested different number of sub-periods and
concluded that the predictive accuracy of the model would be in its highet level when
the number of sub-periods is equal to two), we made the following features for every
single cluster based on Wei & Chiu (2002)’s paper:

66

1.

9. Churn: binary churn labels for each client according to their churn status in
prediction period
Using the first 8 features as the input features to the tree, the “churn” feature as the
output of the tree, and the hit ratio= 1:2 (churner : non-churner), we built different
predictive models for each cluster. At first, based on 75% of data (Training Dataset)
and by utilizing Decision Tree (CART algorithm) the predictive models were
constructed on each of our four developed clusters.
Table 4.5 depicts the performance of the developed churn predictive models for each
cluster based on Gain measure.

Regarding the above figures both simple and cost-sensitive predictive models have a

Additionally, the cost-sensitive learning method has been proven to have contribution
in model building with imbalanced data and it outperforms the simple model (see
figure 4.1 and figure 4.4).

Afterwards, in a comparative approach, the Neural Networks technique and also
different algorithms of the Decision Tree technique were utilized to find the algorithm
with the significant performance for model building on our dataset. With this regard
CART, C5.0, and CHAID algorithms among Decisions Tree algorithms were applied
and their performance was compared with the Neural Networks based constructed
model. After constructing the model by the use of training dataset we applied the
constructed model on the remaining 25% of data (Testing Dataset) with the aim of
validating the model. Our adopted validation method (Single split Model Validation),
has been proven to be an accurate validation method (Montgomery, Li, Srinivasan, &
Liechty, 2004; Swait & Andrews, 2003; Burez & Van den Poel, 2009).
Tables 4.11 to 4.14 represent the performance of our constructed models with

Comparing the performance of our developed models based on gain measure, one can
find that Decision Tree algorithms outperform the Neural Networks algorithm.
Furthermore, examining the gain which has been brought by each of the Decision
Tree based constructed models, one can find that maximum performance will be
gained by utilizing different algorithms of Decision Tree technique for different
clusters. Table 4.15 depicts the most appropriate algorithm among the tested
algorithms, for model building in each cluster.

While the gain factor of random sampling is %20 for the top %20 of the customer
base in all clusters, table 7 depicts that the developed model is able to bring the gain
factor of %80.4, %66.7, %30.6, and %80 for the top %20 of the customer base of our
four developed clusters, respectively. This implies that by applying the developed
multi algorithm predictive model, choosing a sample size of only %20 of each
72

cluster’s customer base is enough for identifying %80.4, %66.7, %30.6, and %80 of
the total number of churners in each of our four clusters, respectively.
Figures 4.5 to 4.8 illustrate the gain diagram of each developed model and as it can
be understood from the figures all developed models have considerable better
performance than the random sampling (diagonal line).

With the intention of handling the class imbalance and similar to our single
algorithm approach we tested the effect of cost-sensitive learning method on the
performance of our developed models on each cluster and surprisingly we found out
that this remedy has negative or no effect on the performance of our multi-algorithm
model.

Chapter 5 Conclusion and Further Research
5.1. Introduction
In the previous chapters after addressing the purpose of the research shedding light
into its importance and magnification, and reviewing its existing literature, we hired
our methodology for conducting the current study. By putting the extracted
methodology into practice we performed our analysis phase which results are
presented in chapter 4. In the current chapter we have discussed the outcome of our
research and derived the proper interpretations from them. Furthermore we have
shared the limitations that we faced with in the way of conducting this research and
also the implications of this research for businesses especially in telecommunications
market segment and ultimately we proposed the research gaps in this area which can
be filled by future researches.

5.2. Conclusion
The problem that Talia Telecommunications Co. was dealing with was to recognize
the customers with high probability of churn in close future and target them with
incentives in order to convince them to stay, but due to the absence of an accurate
76

model for monitoring their clients’ behavior, the company was unable to distinguish
the churners from non-churners. In such case, the company had two ways; whether to
send all customers the incentives, which was clearly the waste of money or to quit the
churn management program and focus on acquisition program which is considerably
more costly than the retention approach.
Under such circumstances the company decided to find a way in order to distinguish
the churners from non-churners. So that the company becomes able to target the right
person with the incentives. In this case, not only the model helps the company to
distinguish the real churners, but also it prevents the waste of money due to the mass
marketing.
The churn predictive modeling is always formulated as a binary classification
modeling and customers are divided into two groups of churners or non-churners.
There exist different data mining techniques, such as Decision tree, Random Forests,
and Neural Networks which have been utilized by experts to construct the predictive
model, and due to the interpretability and more understandable logic of Decision Tree
we chose this technique for our model building.
As it has been addressed in previous chapters the research process of Knowledge
Discovery in Databases consists of different steps which include collecting the data,
selecting the data, processing the data, transforming the data, mining the data, and
evaluating the results.
The data was collected from Talia Co. data base with the approximate size of 1.5 GB
in the form of three txt files which contained 19500504 transactional records,
produced by 34523 customers, in the time period between 1 November 2007 and 31
January 2008. All tree files imported as one single database into Microsoft SQL
Server. Due to the fact that the data was produced by machine there were no missing
values in our data set and so the other preprocessing operations of data such as dat
cleaning were unnecessary.
In transformation step we constructed RFM related features by the use of the raw
transactional data for each customer in the time period between 1 November 2007 and
31 January 2008, and we used the extracted features in clustering the customer base,
77

while the second group of features (the ones that have been used in model building
phase) we considered the observation period for feature construction, which was
extracted after clustering phase for each single cluster, individually.
As it has been mentioned before the whole process of model building consisted of two
steps. In the first step we clustered the customer base, in order to come to a reasonable
definition of churn.
After achieving the insight toward the churn definition, in the second step we
constructed the churn predictive model for each cluster which enabled us to spot the
future churners based on their prior calling behavior.
With the intention of building the predictive model for each cluster I divided the
customer base of each cluster into two data sets: Train (70%) and Test (30%) and by
considering the hit ratio of 2:1 (non-churner : churner) based on Wei & Chiu (
2002)’s study I utilized the under sampling in order to handle the data imbalance and
then conducted the model building phase. With this regard a decision tree were grown
for each cluster. The trees depict that the significant features for churn prediction are
different form a cluster to another. (See table 5.1)

The performance of the Decision Tree models was evaluated by the use of Lift / Gain
Chart. The gain chart was created the developed model of each cluster. With this
regard, it sorts the customers based on likelihood to churn in the descending order.
78

The lift/gain chart showed that if the top 20% of customers in cluster 1, 2, 3, and 4
would be extracted as a sample of customers for sending the incentives, 77.8%,
66.8%, 30%, and 45.5% of the real churners in each cluster would be targeted,
respectively, while this gain measure was 20% for all clusters in random sampling
approach. Furthermore we adopted the cost-sensitive learning approach as another
tools of handling the data imbalance and its promising outcome raised the gain
measure in the first and the fourth cluster.
Consequently the developed models are considerably able to distinguish the churners
form non-churners and help the Talia Co. to conduct a more efficient retention
campaign. In fact by utilizing this approach the Company would be able to not only
reduce the marketing cost and churns rate simultaneously.

5.3. Research Limitations
This research, like all other researches, was not without its limitations. The follow are
some of the limitations that we faced with during our research:
¾ One the major limitations of this research was data classification and data
confidentiality in Talia Co. that prevented us to have access to a part of
customers data such as billing and credit data. This forced us to calculate the
monetary features manually and deprived us form involving the credit features
into our model building.
¾ Lack of demographic data of customers was also our other limitation in
conducting this research. Due to this we were unable to involve such factors in
our clustering phase which was probably able to improve the accuracy and
also interpretability of clusters.

5.4. Managerial implications
The finding of this research has important application for companies that are active
in mobile telecommunications market (Especially the pre-paid ones). Besides the idea
of developing the dual-step model for extracting the churn definition prior to model
building phase, can also be applied in baking industry in regard with building a
predictive model for Debit Card’s customers’ churn.
79

Managing the great deal of data produced by customers in companies and
organizations, can provide them with precious knowledge regarding their customers
which can be exploited in developing new products, conducting retention campaigns,
and also in cross selling and up-selling the products and services of a company. This
demonstrates the significance of application of data mining in marketing. In fact
mining the raw data produced by customers in their touch points with company can
provide the company with a better insight toward their customers which helps them to
conduct more efficient and also more effective marketing investments.
The objective of this research was to develop a predictive model for customer churn
in pre-paid mobile telephony market which is able to distinguish between customers
who are likely to churn in close futures and the ones who are stuck with the company.
The contribution of such model for the company is that it would prevent the waste of
money due to the mass marketing approaches and it enables the companies to target
the real churners by extracting the customers with high probability of churn. Besides,
as discussed in chapter 1 the cost of acquiring a new customer is 8 times more than
retaining an existing one, thus since the churn predictive model is capable of
indicating the future churners, the companies that are intended to maintain their
customer base can focus on retention approaches instead of acquisition approaches
which is clearly less costly.
Summing up the above discussion, in regard with the finding of this research, we can
suggest the companies to utilize the data mining techniques in order to transform the
existing customer data in their databases to exploitable knowledge that can help them
in their marketing plans. Moreover, it would be beneficial for them to build a
predictive churn model by the use of data mining which plays the role of an alerting
system for the companies and also it can help them to spend their retention budget
efficiently.

5.5. Suggestions for Further Research
After conducting the current research, still some interesting areas exist that worth to
be worked on. Additionally the limitations of this study can provide us with the ideas
for future researches:
80

The followings are the further studies which can be done in the realm of current
research:
¾ Developing our model we utilized the TwoStep Cluster in the 1st step as our
clustering technique and Decision Tree classifier as the classification
technique for building the predictive model. It was not our intention to
compare the performance of different clustering techniques and different
classifiers in this research, but for further research it can be suggested to
apply different classification or clustering algorithms and compare the
outcome of them.
¾ Handling the data imbalance we applied two of methods proposed by Weiss
(2004) (i.e. under sampling and cost-sensitive learning) and we found the
results promising. Further research is suggested to utilize the other
approaches of handling the data imbalance proposed by Weiss (2004) and
test the applicability of them.
¾ Since the data base of Talia was suffering from lack of demographic
information of customers, we were unable to use such features in our model
building phase. It is suggested to conduct the current dual-step modeling for
churn prediction on a data base with demographic features and measure the
effect of demographic variables involvement in clustering and classification
accuracy.
